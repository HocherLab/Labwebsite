In the lab, we combine large-scale phylogenetic analyses and systematic evolutionary surveys with high-throughput experimental biology —Proteomics, transcriptomics—to explore DNA-binding proteins and their inhibitors. As a moist lab blending computational approaches with bench experiments, we're curiosity-driven, not afraid of growing a weird bacteria or studying a strange proteins. Our goal is to explore the natural diversity of DNA binding proteins and their inhibitor in a systematic and evolutionary driven fashion. This approach is at the core of our second aim, which is to understand to what extend we can redesign those systems, to understand and engineer them.
