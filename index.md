## Highlights

{% capture text %} DNA genomes have been adopted by almost all forms of life. Consequently, the protein machinery that cells need to use their genetic information is both essential and largely well conserved. Beyond its sequence, DNA doesn’t differ much between altogether unrelated species, and for this reason DNA binding proteins often share structural similarities. The universality of DNA and DNA binding proteins makes horizontal gene transfer and synthetic biology possible, but also makes them vulnerable nodes prone to interference during genetic conflicts.

Our lab focuses on understanding these critical interactions and engineering innovative molecular tools from chromatin proteins and DNA mimics.

{% capture text %} We combine computational structural biology, large-scale phylogenomics, genetics, and experimental evolution to identify, understand, and engineer DNA mimicking proteins (DMPs). These peculiar proteins interact with essential bacterial pathways including CRISPR, restriction-modification systems, and chromatin organization. Our projects span from discovering new DMPs to dissecting their evolutionary roles and designing novel synthetic proteins.

{% capture text %} Our lab is led by Antoine Hocher, who established the MIMIC lab at the Department of Genetics in 2024. Antoine has a Bachelor in Physics and a Master in Systems Biology from École Normale Supérieure (Paris, France). He completed his PhD on yeast heterochromatin silencing at Institut Curie with Angela Taddei, followed by postdoctoral research with Tobias Warnecke at the MRC-London Institute of Medical Sciences, focusing on prokaryotic chromatin systems.

Our interdisciplinary team includes experts in computational biology, phylogenetics, structural biology, synthetic biology, and evolutionary genetics.

Research Interests:

Understanding and engineering chromatin:
Synthetic biology now allows us to redesign entire gene expression systems. We aim to engineer chromatin-based epigenetic mechanisms, discovering novel chromatin proteins across diverse organisms and recreating minimal epigenetic systems from first principles.

Discovering and engineering DNA mimicking proteins:
Molecular mimicry is a fascinating evolutionary strategy used at every biological scale. Our lab systematically identifies, characterizes, and engineers proteins evolved to mimic DNA structures, targeting their potential as modulators of key bacterial functions.

Keywords: phylogenetics, genomics, synthetic biology, genetic conflicts
