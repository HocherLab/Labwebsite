# MIMIC laboratory

Molecular Innovations in Microbial Interactions and Chromatin

The MIMIC Lab is a curiosity-driven research group led by Dr Antoine Hocher at the University of Cambridge dedicated to exploring how evolution shapes chromatin and molecular mimicry. We are located in the heart of Cambridge, in the department of Genetics.


## Highlights

Combining evolutionary thinking with synthetic biology, computational analyses, and experimental approaches, we want to uncover fundamental principles behind DNA-binding proteins and their vulnerabilities during genetic conflicts. Check out past publication from the lab to see what kind of work we have been doing.
