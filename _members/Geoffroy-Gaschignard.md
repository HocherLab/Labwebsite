Dr. Geoffroy Gaschignard is a postdoctoral researcher in the MIMIC Lab, where he has been working since January 2025. He combines bioinformatic analyses with biochemical experiments to study protein families.
Geoffroy holds an engineering degree (equivalent to a Master's) from ESPCI Paris (École Supérieure de Physique et de Chimie Industrielles, Paris, France) and a Master's in Biology (SBCP – Systèmes Biologiques et Concepts Physico-Chimiques, Paris, France).
He completed his PhD in the Biomin team at the IMPMC (Institut de Minéralogie, de Physique des Matériaux et de Cosmochimie, Sorbonne Université, Paris, France), where he investigated the function of calcyanin, a novel protein involved in biomineralization in cyanobacteria.
Currently, his research focuses on developing a bioinformatics pipeline to detect DNA mimic proteins in sequence databases and experimentally validating their functional mimicry.
