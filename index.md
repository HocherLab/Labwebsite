## Highlights

{% capture text %}

The MIMIC Lab is a curiosity-driven research group led by Dr Antoine Hocher at the University of Cambridge dedicated to exploring how evolution shapes chromatin and molecular mimicry. Combining evolutionary thinking with synthetic biology, computational analyses, and experimental approaches, we want to uncover fundamental principles behind DNA-binding proteins and their vulnerabilities during genetic conflicts.
